    <!-- <h1>First Section</h1> -->
    <p id="first-section">My name is <b>Ufonobong Emmanuel</b>. I've been <i>fascinated</i> by technology and all the different ways it may affect our lives ever since I was a young child. 
        My <i>creativity</i>is sparked by technology. Because computers are technology, technology is also enjoyable because it allows you to learn more and experience more. Using technology, you can apply for jobs and schools. There is technology of every kind. 
        There is nothing else on. These are all examples of technological devices: <i> a phone, tablet, computer, watches, cameras, JPs, Xbox, headphones, heaters, robots, and television</i>.</p>
    <!-- <h2>Second Section</h2> -->
    <p id="second-section">I have learnt about <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> and <b>CSS</b> stand for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>
        HTML is the <i>foundation</i> of a website. Its <b>components</b> form the building blocks of all websites
        It contains the <b>information</b> that tells the browser what is on the page in terms of <i>text, links</i>, where to find <i>images</i>.
        CSS makes the <b> front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience</b>. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate.
         In addition to <i>layout</i> and <i>format</i>, CSS is responsible for <i> font, color</i> and more.
    </p>
    <!-- <h2>Third Section</h2> -->
    <p id="third-section"><b>Padding</b>  is the inner space between the <i>content</i> and the <i>border</i> of your box while
         <b>Border</b> is the <i>perimeter</i> of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line then 
        <b>Margin</b> is the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box</p>
